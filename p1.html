            <h2>HISTORY OF DHARWAD</h2>
            <p>Dharwad also known as Dharwar, is a city located in the north western part of the Indian state of
                Karnataka. It is the headquarters of the Dharwad district of Karnataka and forms a contiguous urban area
                with the city
                of Hubballi. It was merged with Hubballi in 1962 to form the twin cities of Hubballi-Dharwad. It covers
                an area of 213 km2 (82 sq mi) and is located 430 km (270 mi) northwest of Bangalore, on NH-48, between
                Bangalore and Pune.In 2016, Hubli-Dharwad was selected for solar city / green city master plans.In 2017,
                government of India included Hubli-Dharwad city for a smart city project, a flagship scheme for overall
                development of infrastructure in the twin-cities.<br>The Chalukyas ruled Dharwad during the 12th
                century. A stone inscription indicates that there was a
                ruler by the name of BhaskaraDeva in 1117. In the 14th century, the district was first overrun by the
                Bahmani Sultanate, after which it was annexed to the newly established Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar, an
                official
                of which named "Dhar Rao", according to local tradition, built the fort at Dharwad town in 1403. After
                the defeat of the king of Vijayanagar in the Battle of Talikota (1565), Dharwad was for a few years
                practically independent under its Hindu governor; but in 1573 the fort was captured by the sultan of
                Bijapur, Adil Shah, and Dharwad was annexed to his dominions. Adil Shah built a fort in an area later
                called Manna Killa,
                and later Nazratabad. With this fort, the strategic importance of Dharwad increased and it attracted the
                attention of subsequent conquerors, including Aurangzeb, Shivaji, Aurangzeb's son Bahadur Shah I, Peshwa
                Balaji Baji Rao, Hyder Ali, Tipu Sultan and finally the British colonizers. In 1685, the fort was taken
                bythe Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, and Dharwad, on the break-up of the Mughal empire, fell under the sway
                of the Maratha Peshwa of Pune. In 1764, the province was overrun by Hyder Ali of
                the Mysore, who in 1778 captured the fort of Dharwad. The fort was retaken in 1791 by the Marathas.
                After the final defeat of the Peshwa by the British in 1818, Dharwar was incorporated into the territory
                of the British East India Company's Bombay Presidency. During the early 19th century, when the British
                were
                expanding their domains, they faced a lot of opposition from local rulers, including Baba Saheb of
                Nargund and Kittur Chennamma.

            the Government of Bombay, played a significant role in and was in charge of ensuring that Karnatak College
            kept offering instruction in the North Karnataka region. The college started with Arts and Science streams,
            and later other streams like Commerce and Economics were added. The college was later bifurcated for
            administration purposes as the Karnatak Arts College and Karnatak Science College, though both continue in

            college.<br>
